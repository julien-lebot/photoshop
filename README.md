# photoshop
A very simple paint program.

This project started as a coding dojo, and the goal was to explore the use of the command pattern with undo / redo support.

The resulting project is not pretty, but it works quite well. It supports:
 - creation of images of various sizes
 - drawing with the mouse
 - inversion of colours
 - filling a region with a colour
 - undo / redo for *all* the commands
 - saving to PNG
 - pan and zoom
 - very slow updates on large images
 
Todo: rotation of the picture (!). It's in there in the Unit Test though.
